The PWSH script performes the following actions when launched:
1. Checks if script was executed as Administrator
2. Creates a log file in the path of the executed script
3. Creates the directories "C:\AtomicRedTeam\ExternalPayloads"
4. Excludes "C:\AtomicRedTeam" in Microsoft Defender
5. Installs and enables Atomic Red Team
6. Simulates ransomware attack by executing a set of Atomic Red Team tests
7. Creates 100 files with extension .tanuki, ransom note and replaces the desktop wallpaper
